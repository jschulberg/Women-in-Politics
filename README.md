# Women-in-Politics
This repository includes a thorough analysis of women who have held elected office since the turn of the 20th Century. I will use a variety of exploratory and modeling techniques to answer the following questions:  

- How many women have held elected office over time?
- Does the number of women who have held elected office differed by political party?
- Has the proportion of women in elected office increased over time?
  
The repository is organized as follows:  

| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Code | This section includes all of the R code used in the analysis. |
| Data | This section includes the main datasets used throughout the analysis. |
| Viz | This section includes all of the main visualizations generated by the R Code in the Code section. |

### Note about the Data
